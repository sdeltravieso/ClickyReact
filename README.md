# ClickyReact

This is a simple memory game. Simply click on all the images without clicking on the same one twice. The images randomly shuffle each time you click.

The game keeps track of your current score, as well as your best score. If you click on an image twice, your current score goes back to 0, but the best score remains. Once you click on all images, the game starts over.
